# capnp-build

A macro for building Cap'n Proto messages in Rust.

This crate provides a single macro, `capnp_build!`, which can be used to
construct Cap'n Proto messages. The macro takes a path to a
`Builder<'_>` type (as generated by capnpc) and a set of fields to set on that builder,
optionally with values to set them to.

The macro supports a variety of syntaxes for setting fields, including:

* Setting a primitive field to a value: `foo = 42`
* Setting a struct field to a nested message: `foo = { bar = 42, baz = 24 }`
* Setting a list field to a list of values: `foo = [1, 2, 3]`
* Setting a list field to a list of messages: `foo = [{ bar = 42 }, { baz = 24 }]`
* Setting a field to the result of a function call: `foo [ foo::init ] = 42`
